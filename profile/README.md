## What is this project
We make a mobile application named **Batin.Co** (). **Batin.Co** is an innovative mobile applications designed for to find out the type of batik and its meaning. Provide users with a comprehensive tool to predict the type of Batik from its model. In the future, we have a plan to add a marketplace feature, so it can help to boost Batik's sales.

1. Work on the project locally in your own computer
2. **Create new Branch** based on the feature you make using " git checkout -b <new_branch> " <br/>
Example :
```
git checkout -b layout-member
```
3. **Commit** changes to your branch. Don't forget to give proper commit message so other people can understand it <br/>
Example:
```
git commit -m "add layout-member"
```
4. **Push** to your branch <br/>
