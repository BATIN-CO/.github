## What is this project
We make a mobile application named **Batin.Co** (). **Batin.Co** is an innovative mobile applications designed for to find out the type of batik and its meaning. Provide users with a comprehensive tool to predict the type of Batik from its model. In the future, we have a plan to add a marketplace feature, so it can help to boost Batik's sales.

## Our Model Performance
Batin.Co model has been trained on 611 labeled Images and got 63% accuracy on test data.

## Guidance for running our model on local
Make sure you intalled all this dependencies first on your local machine:
1. tensorflow
2. matplotlib.pyplot
3. os
4. tensorflow_hub
   
You can use on your local bash env for making things easier with pip. To run the model or test it you can try using on file test_run.ipynb that we have provided in this repository. You can use this following instruction to run it properly:
1. Download test_run.ipynb, Batik_mobilenet.h5, and the Dataset
2. Make sure these three files are on the same directory
3. Run test_run.ipynb file

![Forking pict](https://github.com/BATIN-CO/.github/assets/116961113/8ea00d26-93cc-48b7-82ef-193ecf4c1256) </br>
If you need full code from our application you need to fork all of our repositories. Forking repository allows you to modificate this project without affecting the original project.

### Next Step
1. Work on the project locally in your own computer
2. **Create new Branch** based on the feature you make using " git checkout -b <new_branch> " <br/>
Example :
```
git checkout -b layout-member
```
3. **Commit** changes to your branch. Don't forget to give proper commit message so other people can understand it <br/>
Example:
```
git commit -m "add layout-member"
```
4. **Push** to your branch <br/>
Example:
```
git push origin layout-member
```
